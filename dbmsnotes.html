  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>Raw, unprocessed facts or details without context or meaning. Data is unorganized and often collected from observations, measurements, or recordings.</p>
  <p><B>Examples:</B> Numbers, dates, text, images, or symbols that need interpretation (e.g., "25," "2023-09-04," or "John").</p>

  <h2>Information</h2>
  <p>Processed, organized, or structured data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making or understanding. Information is data that has been
interpreted, giving it context and significance.</p>
  <p><B>Examples:</B> A report showing the average temperature, a summarized sales report, or an analyzed dataset showing trends.</p>
<h2>Record</h2><p>Record is the collection of various types of data of similar field.</p>
<h2>Data file:-</h2><p>Data file is the collection of record some time called table.</p>

  <h2>Data Persistent </h2>
  <p>Persistent data is information that is stored in a way that it
remains available even after the system or device that created it is turned off or
restarted.<br>
Persistent data doesn't disappear when you turn off your computer or close an
app. It's saved on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, or databases.<br>
Persistent data is crucial for things you need to keep over time, like files,
settings, or records in a business..</p>

  <h2>Database</h2>
  <p>A database is an organized collection of data. The data can be anything
from a list of names and phone numbers to detailed records of transactions in a
company. Databases are structured to allow easy retrieval, insertion, updating, and
deletion of data.</p>

  <h2>File</h2>
  <p>A file is a collection of data stored on a computer or other devices. Files can contain
different types of data, such as text, images, videos, or software programs. Each file
has a name and usually an extension that indicates the type of data it holds (e.g., .txt
for text files, .jpg for images, .mp4 for videos).</p>

  <h2>File Management System</h2>
  <p>A file management system is a software that helps you organize, store, retrieve, and
manage files on your computer or device. It provides tools to perform tasks like:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Creating file:</b><p>You can create new files for storing information.</p></li>
    <li><b>Organizing files:</b><p>Files can be grouped into folders or directories, making them
easier to find and manage.</p></li>
    <li><b>Editing files:</b><p>You can open and make changes to the content of files.</p></li>
    <li><b>Saving files:</b><p>Changes made to files can be saved to keep the information up to
date.</p></li>
    <li><b>Deletinf files:</b><p>You can remove files you no longer need.</p></li>
    <li><b>Searching for files:</b><p>The system allows you to search for files by name, type, or
other criteria.</p></li>
    <li><b>Backing up files:</b><p>Important files can be copied to another location to prevent
loss.</p></li>
</ul>

  <h2>File Structure</h2>
  <p>File structure refers to the way data is arranged within a file. This arrangement can
vary depending on the file type, but it typically involves a combination of headers,
metadata, and data content.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Text Files:</b><p>Typically organized as a sequence of lines, each ending with a
newline character.</p></li>
    <li><b>Database Files:</b><p>Often have a structured format, such as a relational database
that stores data in tables with rows and columns.</p></li>
</ul>

  <h2>File Organization</h2>
  <p>File Structure refers to the way files are arranged on a storage device. This
organization is often hierarchical, with files grouped into directories (or folders).</p>

  <h3>Types of File Organization</h3>
  <p>There are several types of file organization in database management systems (DBMS), each
with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific application
requirements. Here are some of the most common types:</p>
  <ul>
    <h3><i>Sequential File Organization</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Description</b><p>Records are stored in a sequential order based on a primary key.</p></li>
        <li><b>Advantages:</b><p>Simple to implement and efficient for sequential access.</p></li>
        <li><b>Disadvantages:</b><p>Inefficient for random access, insertions, and deletions.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i>Indexed Sequential File Organization:</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Description:</b><p>Records are stored in a sequential order, but an index is maintained to
provide efficient random access.</p></li>
        <li><b>Advantages:</b><p>Efficient for both sequential and random access.</p></li>
        <li><b>Disadvantages:</b><p>More complex to implement and requires additional storage for the
index.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i>Direct File Organization:</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Description:</b><p>Records are stored based on a calculated address using a hashing
function.</p></li>
        <li><b>Advantages:</b><p>Very efficient for random access.</p></li>
        <li><b>Disadvantages:</b><p>Can suffer from collisions, which can lead to inefficient access.</p></li>
        
    </ul>
     <h3><i>Clustered File Organization:</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Description:</b><p>Records are grouped together based on a common attribute.</p></li>
        <li><b>Advantages:</b><p>Efficient for queries involving the clustering attribute.</p></li>
        <li><b>Disadvantages:</b><p>Less efficient for queries involving other attributes.</p></li>
        
    </ul>
     <h3><i>Hash File Organization:</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Description:</b><p>Similar to direct file organization, but uses a more complex hashing
function to reduce collisions.</p></li>
        <li><b>Advantages:</b><p>Very efficient for random access and has fewer collisions than direct file
organization.</p></li>
        <li><b>Disadvantages:</b><p>More complex to implement.</p></li>
        
    </ul>
     <h3><i>Multi-level Indexing:</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Description:</b><p>Uses multiple levels of indexes to provide efficient access to large
datasets.</p></li>
        <li><b>Advantages:</b><p>Can handle very large datasets efficiently.</p></li>
        <li><b>Disadvantages:</b><p>More complex to implement and requires additional storage for the
indexes.</p></li>
        
    </ul>

  <h2>Database Management System (DBMS)</h2>
  <p>It's like a digital librarian that helps you organize, store, and retrieve information
efficiently. Imagine a library with countless books. A DBMS is the system that helps
you find the exact book you need, even if it's buried among millions of others.</p>

    <h3>How a DBMS Works:-</h3>
    <ol type="numbers">
        <li><b>Data Storage:</b><p>The DBMS stores data in a structured format, often using tables.
Each table has rows (records) and columns (fields).</p></li>
        <li><b>Data Manipulation:</b><p>You can use the DBMS to add, delete, or modify data. For
instance, you could add a new customer to the customer table.</p></li>
        <li><b>Data Retrieval:</b><p>The DBMS allows you to query the data to find specific
information. For example, you could search for all customers living in a
particular city.</p></li>
        <li><b>Data Security:</b><p>The DBMS ensures that your data is protected from
unauthorized access. It includes features like user authentication and data
encryption.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Why Use a DBMS?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Efficiency:</b><p>DBMSs are designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently,
making it easy to find and manage information.</p></li>
    <li><b>Consistency:</b><p>DBMSs help maintain data consistency, ensuring that information
is accurate and up-to-date.</p></li>
    <li><b>Security:</b><p>DBMSs provide security features to protect your data from
unauthorized access and corruption.</p></li>
    <li><b>Data Sharing:</b><p>DBMSs allow multiple users to access and share data
simultaneously.</p></li>
</ul>


  <h2>Evolution of Databases and DBMS</h2>
  <p>Databases have been around for centuries, but the way we manage and interact with
them has evolved significantly over time.</p>

1970s, revolutionized database management. It represented data as tables,
with rows and columns.</p></Li>
    <Li><b>SQL:</b><p>The Structured Query Language (SQL) was developed to interact with
relational databases. It provided a standardized way to query, update, and
manage data.</p></Li>
</ul>
  <h3>NoSQL Databases: Scalability and Flexibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>NoSQL:</b><p>NoSQL databases, also known as "Not Only SQL," emerged to address
the limitations of relational databases for large-scale, distributed applications.
They offer flexibility, scalability, and high performance.</p></li>
        <li><b>Types of NoSQL:</b><p>Document databases (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g.,
Redis), wide-column databases (e.g., Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g.,
Neo4j) are common types of NoSQL databases.</p></li>
      
    </ul>
    <h3>Cloud-Based Databases: The Future</h3>
    <ul>

  <p>A DBMS is like a digital librarian that helps you organize, store, and retrieve
information efficiently. It consists of several key components:</p>



<!---------above -->



<!----------- html comments -->

  <ol>
    <li><b>Data</b><p>This is the raw information you want to store, like customer details, product
information, or sales records.</p></li>
    <Li>
      <b>Schema:</b>
      <p> This is the blueprint or structure of the data. It defines how the data is
organized and related to each other.</p>
    </Li>
    <Li>
      <b>Software:</b>
      <p>This is the actual DBMS system, which provides tools to interact with the
data. It includes features like data entry, retrieval, and modification.</p>
    </Li>
    <Li>
      <b>Hardware:</b>
      <p>This refers to the physical components of the system, such as servers,
storage devices, and networking equipment.</p>
    </Li>
    <Li>
      <b>User:</b>
      <p>These are the people who interact with the DBMS. They can be database
administrators, developers, or end-users.</p>
    </Li>
    <Li>
      <b>Produres:</b>
      <p>These are the rules and guidelines that govern how the DBMS is used.
They include things like data security protocols and backup procedures.</p>
    </Li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Advantages of DBMS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Controls redundancy</b>
      <p> It can control data redundancy because it
stores all the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed
in the database.</p></li>
    <li><b>Data sharing</b>
    <p>In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the
data among multiple users.</p></li>
    <li><b>Easy maintenance</b>
    <p>It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized
nature of the database system.</p></li>
    <li><b>Reduced development time</b>
    <p>It reduces development time and maintenance need.</p></li>
    <li><b>Backup and recovery support</b>
    <p> It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic
backup of data from hardware and software failures and restores the data if
required.</p></li>
    <li><b>Multiple user interfaces</b>
    <p>It provides different types of user interfaces like
graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces</p></li>
  </ul>
<h3>Disadvantages of DBMS</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cost of Hardware and Software</b>
    <p>It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Size</b>
    <p>It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Complexity</b>
    <p>Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Higher impact of failure</b>
    <p>Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-left: 5%;">
<h2>DBMS Users</h2>
<p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that helps you manage data efficiently. To use a DBMS, there are different types of users, each with specific roles and responsibilities.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Database Administrator (DBA)</h3>
    <b>Role:</b>
    <p>The primary person responsible for managing the DBMS.</p>

      <li>Ensuring data security and integrity</li>
      <li>Optimizing database performance</li>
      <li>Troubleshooting database issues</li>
      <li>Implementing backup and recovery procedures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Application Developers</h3>

    <p>Create software applications that interact with the database.</p>
    <b>Responsibilities:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing and coding application logic</li>
      <li>Writing SQL queries to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data</li>
      <li>Integrating the application with the DBMS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>End Users</h3>
    <b>Role:</b>
    <p>People who use the applications created by developers to access and manipulate data.</p>
    <b>Responsibilities:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Entering data into the system</li>
      <li>Retrieving information from the database</li>
      <li>Making decisions based on the data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Data Analysts</h3>
    <b>Role:</b>
    <p>Analyze data to extract meaningful insights.</p>
    <b>Responsibilities:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Using SQL and data analysis tools to query and manipulate data</li>
      <li>Creating reports and visualizations</li>
      <li>Identifying trends and patterns in the data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>System Administrators</h3>
    <b>Role:</b>
    <p>Responsible for the overall IT infrastructure, including the DBMS.</p>
    <b>Responsibilities:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Installing and configuring the DBMS</li>
      <li>Managing system resources</li>
      <li>Ensuring system security</li>
    </ul>

</ol>
</div>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Imagine a bank. The DBA would be responsible for creating and maintaining the bank's
database, ensuring data security, and optimizing performance. The application developers
would create the online banking system. End users would be the customers who use the
online banking system to check balances, transfer funds, and pay bills. Data analysts would
analyze customer behavior to identify trends and improve marketing strategies. System
administrators would ensure the overall stability and security of the bank's IT infrastructure,
including the DBMS.</p>

<div class="container mt-4">
  <h2><strong>DBMS Architecture</strong></h2>
  <p>A Database store a lot of critical information to access data quickly and securely. Hence it is important to select the correct architecture for efficient data management. DBMS Architecture helps users to get their requests done while connecting to the database. We choose database architecture depending on several factors like the size of the database, number of users, and relationships between the users. There are two types of database models that we generally use, are logical model and physical model.</p>

  <h3><strong>Types of DBMS Architecture</strong></h3>
  <p>There are several types of DBMS Architecture that we use according to the usage requirements. Types of DBMS Architecture are discussed here.</p>
  <ul> <b>
    <li>1-Tier Architecture</li>
    <li>2-Tier Architecture</li>
    <li>3-Tier Architecture</li>
    </b>
  </ul>

  <h3>1-Tier Architecture</h3>
  <p>In 1-Tier Architecture the database is directly available to the user, the user can directly sit on the DBMS and use it that is, the client, server, and Database are all present on the same machine. For Example: to learn SQL we set up an SQL server and the database on the local system. This enables us to directly interact with the relational database and execute operations. The industry wonâ€™t use this architecture they logically go for 2-Tier and 3-Tier Architecture.</p>

  alt="DBMS 1-Tier Architecture">

            <figcaption>This is 1-Tier Architecture diagram.</figcaption><br>

  <h3>Advantages of 1-Tier Architecture</h3>
  <p><strong>Simple Architecture:</strong> 1-Tier Architecture is the most simple architecture to set up, as only a single machine is required to maintain it.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> No additional hardware is required for implementing 1-Tier Architecture, which makes it cost-effective.</p>
  <p><strong>Easy to Implement:</strong> 1-Tier Architecture can be easily deployed, and hence it is mostly used in small projects.</p>
<h3>2-Tier Architecture:-</h3>
<p>The 2-tier architecture is similar to a basic client-server model. The application at the client
end directly communicates with the database on the server side. APIs like ODBC and JDBC
are used for this interaction. The server side is responsible for providing query processing
and transaction management functionalities. On the client side, the user interfaces and
application programs are run. The application on the client side establishes a connection
with the server side in order to communicate with the DBMS. An advantage of this type is
that maintenance and understanding are easier, and compatible with existing systems.
However, this model gives poor performance when there are a large number of users.</p>

            <figcaption>This is 2-Tier Architecture diagram.</figcaption><br><br>
<h3>Advantages of 2-Tier Architecture:-</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Easy to Access:</strong> 2-Tier Architecture makes easy access to the database, which makes fast retrieval.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Scalable:</strong> We can scale the database easily, by adding clients or by upgrading hardware.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Low Cost:</strong> 2-Tier Architecture is cheaper than 3-Tier Architecture and Multi-Tier Architecture.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Easy Deployment:</strong> 2-Tier Architecture is easy to deploy than 3-Tier Architecture.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Simple:</strong> 2-Tier Architecture is easily understandable as well as simple because of only two components.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>3-Tier Architecture</h2>
<p>
  In 3-Tier Architecture, there is another layer between the client and the server. The client does not directly communicate with the server. Instead, it interacts with an application server which further communicates with the database system and then the query processing and transaction management takes place. This intermediate layer acts as a medium for the exchange of partially processed data between the server and the client. This type of architecture is used in the case of large web applications.
